### About the project
#### Add in the video that we produced here

This project aims to highlight the amount of time, resources and labour one spends coping with menstruation.

Our project sheds light on the often hidden and stigmatized inconveniences people face throughout their lifetime because of menstruation. We thus wish to proudly take ownership of our personal experiences with menstruation, and spark greater conversations around female reproductive health.

Pepi first collected the number of times in which they scrubbed individual underwear stained with menstrual blood over the course of 11 days. They also recorded the time in which they scrubbed their underwear each day. You can view this data in the CSV file in the "Menstrual Data" folder.

We then coded the robotic arm to scrub one of our (actual) period-stained underwear the respective number of times at the respective times of day. At the end of the 11 days, the dataset automatically starts again at Day 0.
